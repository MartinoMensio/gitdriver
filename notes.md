    most widely used techniques and YZ are more different between

    corpora. Swap order of RQ1 and RQ2: first detection then insights.
    Sharpen RQs for what I've done. RQ4 out of context, needs to be
    linked better. What led me to think this was a RQ after RQ3? Event

    move it. Or fix it quickly or discard. What conclusion does it have?
    Are quoted sentences similar to the rest of the article? If too
    different, may be a problem because reported sentences may express
    something different (only selection of sentences as a filter). How
    much quotation in average? If too high, it's definitely a

[Discussion:]{.c2}

-   [Questions from Alistair reading:]{.c2}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Terminology: the term \"proxy\" does not fit. Better to chage it to
    "mean" or even better to "technique" → [Linguistic techniques of
    persuasion.]{.c11}
-   [RQs: I kind of see where you\'re going with your RQs, but I\'m not
    sure they\'re as clearly expressed as they could be. RQ2 if
    differences are reflective of persuasion techniques? RQ3 Which are
    the possible indicators of these differences?\" -\> \"How can we
    automatically detect those techniques \[which are used by writers to
    persuade\]?\"]{.c2}
-   [\"sentiment itself is not very precise to indicate the
    persuasion,\" I\'m not sure what you mean by this → better using
    propaganda, but needs rephrasing.]{.c2}
-   ["We are  using  several  proxies  that  we  assume  to  be  related
     to  persuasion:   sentiment(subjectivity), propaganda and
    populism.\" I imagine that there\'s probably quite a lot of
    linguistics literature in this area that you should look at, if only
    to pin down your terminology. → easier to work out the terminology.
    At the moment I have persuasion (as top) then prop/sentiment/ that
    are subclassses. Look in literature.]{.c2}
-   [From \"Stats over our datasets\": I\'m not sure what you\'ve done
    about the three systems you\'ve just described. Is this section
    supposed to explain how you chose one of them? Yes explain how they
    were used together (combined), and how they perform separately on
    the dataset (justifying why all of them). Before next section.]{.c2}
-   [s4.3.2: there seems quite a lot of discussion of techniques (eg.
    agglomerative clustering etc.) without much discussion of what
    you\'re trying to achieve, or how the techniques will help you
    achieve it. → for doing what? More motivation, this is only
    operational.]{.c2}

```{=html}

[Discussion:]{.c2}

-   [Decide what is the problem that you are targeting: the biases in

    because it's easier to have evidence demonstrating it.]{.c2}
-   [Discrepancy between the problem targeted and the solution I give.

    predictor of the leaning of the source. I\'ve suggested to Martino
    that he start working on a formal write up of the results. The story

-   [The main narrative: 1. comparing/understanding documents to see
    overlap (limitations). 2. Expand on similarity. 3 Small differences,
    level of detail to see that is the same/different. 4 Sentiment: one
    aspect is strength/polarity to characterise difference. How
    information compares across different articles. Then on 5 Leaning is
    brought in, and similarity was discarded to go on the classifier.
    Now what we want to do? Bring back similarity or not? Political
    leaning would be used to understand how to compare the articles,
    fitting in the main narrative instead of being the final goal.]{.c2}
-   [Experiment 7 would need to bring closer to the original RQ and
    direction. For the topics, standard LDA or similar, how would it
    differ from the AllSides/TextRazor topics? If this experiment does
    not bring closer to the original direction, maybe it's better to
    dump it.]{.c2}
-   [Need to expand on what was learned into how it is incorporated in
    the final work. For example the connections between the different
    experiments, and the red thread that is my chosen narrative. Or for

    retweets and build a cascade model of tweets and users then apply DL
    on the graph to measure if true or not based on spread patterns.
